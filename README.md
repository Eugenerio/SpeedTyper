# SpeedTyper

Speed Typer is a fun and interactive website that lets users test their typing speed and accuracy.

Users can start a test by clicking the 'Start Test' button, at which point a random quote will appear on the screen. Once the quote appears, the user can start typing the quote in the 'Type here when you are ready to start...' text area.

As the user types, the website compares the user's input with the actual quote, and displays any mistakes in real time. If the user makes a mistake, the website will highlight the incorrect character and update the mistake count. If the user corrects the mistake, the highlight will turn green to indicate a correct input.

Once the user has finished typing the quote, they can click the 'Stop Test' button to view their results. The website will display the user's accuracy and words per minute (WPM).

This website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Quotable API to generate random quotes for users to type, and implements an algorithm to compare user input with the actual quote.
